# Notes: ML Landscape

A few questions the intrigued me on the first page of chapter one, were:
* Where does machine learning start and where does it end?
* What exactly does it mean for a machine to learn something?

# What is Machine Learning?

* Machine learning is the science (and art) of programming so that they can learn from data.
* Machine is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being exlicitly programmed.

Machine Learning is great for:
* Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of fine-tuning or defining a long list of rules. Machine Learning algorithms can simplify code and perform better than traditional approaches.
* Complex problems for which traditional approach yields no good solution.
* Fluctuating environment: ML systems can adapt to new data.
* Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data: Data Mining.

Examples of ML Applications:
1. Detecting tumors in brain scans
2. Summarizing long documents automatically
3. Customer segmentation based on their purchases so that you can design different marketing strategies
4. Recommending an offering that a client may be interested in, based on past user activity
5. Building an intelligent bot for a game
